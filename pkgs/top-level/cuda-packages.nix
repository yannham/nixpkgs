  # Silvan (Tweag) covered some things on recursive attribute sets in the Nix Hour:
  # https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgnUFtd1Ivs
  #
  # I highly recommend watching it.
  #
  # Most helpful comment regarding recursive attribute sets:
  # 
  # https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/256324#issuecomment-1749935979
  # 
  # To summarize:
  # 
  # - `prev` should only be used to access attributes which are going to be overriden.
  # - `final` should only be used to access `callPackage` to build new packages.
  # - Attribute names should be computable without relying on `final`.
  #   - Extensions should take arguments to build attribute names before relying on `final`.
  # 
  # TODO(@connorbaker): A big problem with this is that the attribute names of the CUDA extension
  # depend on `cudaVersion`, as the version determines which packages are available.
  # In this first iteration, we're going to structure these extensions so they produce attribute sets
  # mapping package name (computed using the `cudaVersion` from the top of this file, not from `final`)
  # to package derivation.
  # I don't know how this will interact with overrides.

  #   // (final.callPackage ../development/cuda-modules/setup-hooks {})
  # as it would result in infinite recursion. Why? The latter requires using `final.callPackage` to
  # compute the attribute names while the former does not.
